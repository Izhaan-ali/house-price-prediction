## House Price Pediction 

This project uses machine learning to predict house prices based on area. The goal is to build accurate and interpretable models using:

Linear Regression

Lasso Regression (L1 regularization)

Ridge Regression (L2 regularization)

These models help in understanding the impact of each feature on the price, while regularization techniques (Lasso & Ridge) prevent overfitting and enhance model generalization. The dataset is cleaned, preprocessed, and split into training and test sets to evaluate model performance using metrics like RMSE.
